# Capstone
Capstone project for Masters in Data Analytics from NWMS University.  This report and study is authored by Amber Speer.

## Introduction
This project will be to analyze housing prices based on a myriad of factors.  The goal is to demonstrate a project that could answer the questions:
1.	How much is this house worth?
2.	How much would these updates increase the value of the house?

## Data 
Because of the limited timeline for this project and the fact that it is to serve as an example of what can be done with data from a given region, this study is using a dataset made for a competition. This type of dataset is made to provide data that is ready-made for analytics. In real-world situations, the data collection would be an enormous, and very important part of the process. However, since
the purpose of this project is to demonstrate the authorâ€™s analytical skills, this is a reasonable shortcut to take.  The dataset for this project is the Ames Housing dataset [4] compiled by Dean De Cock. He complied it to be used data science education settings as a more modern alternative to the popular Boston Housing Dataset. It was found on Kaggle at: <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques>
